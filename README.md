# Object-Detection-Via-OPENCV
This project explores object detection in images and videos using OpenCV and Python. Object detection is crucial in applications like surveillance, autonomous systems, and industrial automation.
üöÄ Project 1: Delivery Route Optimization (Travelling Salesman Problem - TSP)

Overview
This project addresses delivery route optimization using the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The objective is to determine the shortest path for a delivery worker visiting multiple customer locations.

Implementation
The solution is implemented using four different algorithms:

Nearest Neighbour Algorithm (Greedy approach using Euclidean distance)
Held-Karp Algorithm (Dynamic Programming)
Genetic Algorithm (Metaheuristic approach)
Brute Force (Exact approach)
Results & Insights
The Nearest Neighbour approach is computationally efficient but may not always yield the optimal solution.
The Held-Karp Algorithm guarantees an optimal solution but has a high computational cost.
The Genetic Algorithm balances performance and accuracy.
The Brute Force method finds the best path but is impractical for large datasets.
üìç Key Takeaway: TSP solutions are invaluable in logistics, supply chain management, and delivery route planning.

üì∑ Project 2: Object Detection via OpenCV

Overview
This project explores object detection in images and videos using OpenCV and Python. Object detection is crucial in applications like surveillance, autonomous systems, and industrial automation.

Implementation
Feature detection: Identifies objects based on pixel variations.
Homography-based bounding box: Uses geometric transformations to place bounding boxes around detected objects.
Object classification: Utilises Python‚Äôs object-oriented programming to categorise detected items.
Challenges & Insights
Variations in size, orientation, and lighting conditions impact detection accuracy.
Homography techniques improve object recognition by stabilising perspective shifts.
Future work could involve integrating deep learning (YOLO, Faster R-CNN) for improved accuracy.
